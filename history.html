            <h2><em>Origins</em></h2>
            <p class="one">Islam began in the 7th century CE in the Arabian Peninsula. The Prophet Muhammad, born in Mecca in 570 CE, received revelations from Allah through the angel Gabriel. These revelations were later compiled into the Quran, the holy book of Islam. Muhammad's teachings spread rapidly across the Arabian Peninsula and laid the foundation for the Islamic faith.</p>

        <section id="caliphates" class="content-section">
            <h2><em>Early Caliphates</em></h2>
            <p class="one">Following the death of Muhammad in 632 CE, the leadership of the Muslim community was taken up by the Caliphs. The Rashidun Caliphate (632-661 CE) was the first, followed by the Umayyad Caliphate (661-750 CE) and the Abbasid Caliphate (750-1258 CE). These caliphates were marked by significant expansion of Islamic territories and the establishment of key administrative and legal systems.</p>

        <section id="golden-age" class="content-section">
            <h2><em>Golden Age of Islam</em></h2>
            <p class="one">The Golden Age of Islam, roughly from the 8th to the 14th centuries, was a period of great scientific, cultural, and intellectual achievements. Major advancements were made in fields such as mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and philosophy. Scholars like Al-Khwarizmi and Avicenna made lasting contributions to knowledge and learning, influencing both the Islamic world and Europe.</p>

        <section id="modern-era" class="content-section">
            <h2><em>Modern Era</em></h2>
            <p class="one">The modern era in Islamic history saw the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the subsequent rise of nation-states in the Middle East and North Africa. The 19th and 20th centuries were marked by colonialism, the struggle for independence, and the formation of new countries. Today, the Muslim world continues to navigate the challenges and opportunities of the contemporary global landscape.</p>
